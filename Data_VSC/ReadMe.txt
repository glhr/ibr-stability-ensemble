Two conditions are considered:
1. OP_sin represents the operating of a single converter. The 1st row represents the voltage (V); the second row represents the active power (P); the third row represents the reactive power (Q); the fourth row represents system stability (1 for unstable and 0 for stable). Each column represents a sample.
2. OP_mul represents the operating of two paralleled converters. The 1st row represents the voltage at PCC (V); the second row represents the active power of VSC1 (P); the third row represents the reactive power of VSC1 (Q); the fourth row represents the active power of VSC2 (P); the fifth row represents the reactive power of VSC2 (Q);the sixth row represents system stability (1 for unstable and 0 for stable). Each column represents a sample.
